# Kalman Filtering Examples

I followed Simon Levy's [EKF tutorial](https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/kalman_tutorial/) which is simple and approachable. This repository has simulated examples written in python I was inspired to build after reading through his content.

Another compelling introductory text is [rlabbe's Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python). 

Examples include:

* Single-valued linear Kalman Filter

#### Todo:

* Sample a function as example data instead of hardcoded values
* Sample a Gaussian noise distribution instead of hardcoded measurements
* Multi-valued linear sensor fusing Kalman Filter
* Nonlinear state transition and sensor functions for an Extended Kalman Filter
* Arduino C implementation for sensor fusion of an actual IMU's data
